# LaTeX templates

Simple LaTeX templates to fasten production of reports or assignments.

## Getting Started

Running on macOS systems

### Prerequisites

For some of the classes, make sure you have the right fonts installed on your
machine.

### Installing

I personally put my LaTeX custom classes in the `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local`
directory.

You can then just use the `\documentclass{myclass}` command to use the classes
you put in that folder.
